# Neytype-Generator
Generator that let's you write in neytype
Simple neytype generator.
This is essentially a generator that creates image tags.
Each letter read in the input is translated to a neytype image tag
The images are all hosted in imgur and a JSON file is used to keep track of each individual link
I will add the original png image files
If you want to see the json file, access: http://myjson.com/136ura , https://api.myjson.com/bins/136ura (for direct access)
The imgur album is hosted here: https://imgur.com/a/ntNZjGJ
All the letters and original art was created by Luciano Jacob
